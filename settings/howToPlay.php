        <p><b>Movement:</b> Press Up, Down, Left, and Right to move your character around the map <br><br>
         
        <b>Objective:</b> You have only one life and your objective is to complete as many levels as possible while obtaining coins to reach the top of the leaderboard. <br><br>
           
        <b>Coins:</b> Coins are scattered around the map with the amount varying on the level. Collect one coin to obtain 5 points. <br><br>

        <b>Missiles:</b> Missiles are projectiles that will be coming at you from the left and right sides. If one of these missiles hit you, than it is game over. As you complete levels, the missile speed will exponentially increase and the quantity will also increase. <br><br>

        <b>Leaderboard:</b> The leaderboard will be available after you have finished your game. The score system of the game will be 15 points for each level that is completed, 5 points for each coin that is accumalated throughout the game, and 1 point for each second that is left after you complete the level. For example, if you beat a level in 5 seconds, but the projected time to complete it was 10 seconds. Then the result will be that you gain 5 additional points. The leaderboard will be ranked from 1-500 with the option to see how you did compared to other players.
